			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> I write code for a living and I write literary pieces for fun.  My software development style comes with a unique twist in that I have multiple talents.  
In essence, I write code well and I write well.  </p>

<p>I really enjoy the creative and mathematical side of programming.  I love the process of having an idea and then making it come to fruition.  Come along with me in this process! </p> 

<p> If you want a personable software developer who enjoys working with her clients as much as she enjoys programming the application, then I am your person!  
Give me a shout out from the details on my Contact Me page!  I look forward to hearing from you!  </p>
